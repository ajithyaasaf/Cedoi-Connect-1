# Vercel Deployment Guide for CEDOI Madurai Forum

## Current Issue Resolution

The issue with your Vercel deployment showing raw code instead of the application has been fixed. The problem was that Vercel needed proper configuration for a React SPA with Firebase backend.

## Fixed Files

1. **vercel.json** - Created proper Vercel configuration for static React app
2. **PWA Icons** - Added placeholder icons for the manifest
3. **Build Configuration** - Updated to build only frontend for static deployment

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Repository Setup
Ensure your repository has these files:
- `vercel.json` (already created)
- `client/public/manifest.json` (updated)
- `client/public/icon-*.png` (created)

### 2. Environment Variables in Vercel

You need to set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### 3. Build Settings in Vercel

- **Framework Preset**: Vite
- **Build Command**: `vite build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

### 4. Deployment Process

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set the environment variables above
3. Configure build settings as specified
4. Deploy

## Technical Details

### What Was Fixed

1. **Static Build Configuration**: Changed from Express full-stack to React SPA
2. **Path Resolution**: Fixed component import paths for production build
3. **PWA Assets**: Added required manifest and icon files
4. **Routing**: Configured SPA routing with proper rewrites

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: React SPA built with Vite
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore (serverless)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Hosting**: Vercel static hosting
- **PWA**: Service worker and manifest for offline functionality

### Build Process

The build now:
1. Builds the React frontend only (`vite build`)
2. Outputs to `dist/public/` directory
3. Includes all PWA assets and manifest
4. Optimizes for production deployment

## Testing Locally

To test the production build locally:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Serve the build directory
npx serve dist/public
```

## Firebase Configuration

Make sure your Firebase project is properly configured:

1. **Authentication**: Enable Email/Password authentication
2. **Firestore**: Set up database with proper security rules
3. **Hosting Rules**: Configure for SPA routing

## Expected Result

After deployment, your application should:
- Load the React application correctly
- Show the CEDOI Madurai Forum interface
- Allow user authentication and meeting management
- Work as a PWA with offline capabilities

## Troubleshooting

If you still see code instead of the app:
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify build command is `vite build`
3. Ensure output directory is `dist/public`
4. Clear Vercel deployment cache and redeploy

The deployment should now work correctly at https://cedoi-connect-1.vercel.app/
